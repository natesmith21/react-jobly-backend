<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an assingment I completed towards the end of my Software Engineering Certificate. I have struggled a bit with deploying this project.

This is only the backend of the App. I was provided a start for this appliction. This powers: 

* Authentication (using JWT)
* GET/POST/PATCH to DB (postgresql) for users, job applications, as well as admin access to create companies and jobs
* simple testing
